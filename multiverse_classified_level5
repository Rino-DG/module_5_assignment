# Hello fellow avenger, welcome to the multiverse initiative aka M.I..
## We must follow these steps in order to research more about the multiverse
*To do this*
1. Contact Dr.Strange
2. Contact Wanda
3. Contact Wong

From contributer Aebriane Venezuela:
5. Contact a spiderman for experiences and additional information
6. If more than one spiderman is available, contact them!

4. Watch the first Dr.Strange movie if you haven't already, like bruh, you should've watched it already. You livin under a rock? Or the rock? Do you smell what he is cooking? 
### Do you think that there should be any changes in the to do list? If so, edit the list as you may, and I will discuss this with the avengers. How do I know them? I don't. 
### Idk how I am going to get it to them but yeah. Life is rough.
